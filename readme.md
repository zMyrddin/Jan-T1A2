Nav bar to get around the site

### Body
The main content of the pages


## Pages

### Home
Home Page. Displays welcome image and welcome text. fun little tidbit, the image changes if it's a different size! 

### Projects
Stuff that is full of lorem ipsums. e.g. a box of Java with lorem ipsum text, same with HTML box. same with python box. This is a very basic use of Grid with different fr's/


### Blogs
6 blog posts that are taking the images from an online source with Lorem Ipsum text.

### About me
Some info about me like my interests and places I worked in

### Contact Me
Page where you can send me a message that currently goes to nowhere (currently has text boxes that you can fill in as well). and a place to download my CV.  This one is also a maybe better approach in using grid. In this page, if you click on the text for the cv then it will prompt a download wherein if you click on the image of the cv, it will open the cv in a different tab.
